```{r}
source('library.R')
```


```{r}
names(loans)
```
Subset the data set to Zimbabwe.
```{r}
Zimbabwe <- loans %>% filter(country == "Zimbabwe")
```

select the fields country and borrower_genders only
```{r}
gender <- loans %>% select(country, ends_with("genders"))
gender
```


```{r}
library(stringr)
```

```{r}

#Zimbabwe %>% filter(borrower_genders %in% "female") %>% 
#  select(sector,country,loan_amount,borrower_genders)

Zimbabwe %>% mutate(gender = str_detect(borrower_genders, "female")) %>% 
  select(sector,country,loan_amount,borrower_genders,gender)
```

```{r}
Zimbabwe %>% mutate(gender = grepl("^female",borrower_genders)) %>% 
  select(gender,borrower_genders,sector,country,loan_amount) %>% 
  filter(grepl("^male,",borrower_genders))
```



Take a look at odd values of borrower_genders
```{r}
loans %>% 
  group_by(borrower_genders) %>% 
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  arrange(n)
```
